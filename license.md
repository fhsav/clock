# SUMMARY (IN PLAIN-ENGLISH)

Congratulations, you’ve got something with the best license ever.

Basically, you’re free to do what you want with it; as long as you do something good (help someone out, smile; just be nice), you can use this on anything you fancy.

Of course, if it all breaks, it’s totally not the author’s fault.
Enjoy!
